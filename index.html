        <p>Everywhere can be a nap spot but not everywhere can be a comfortable napping spot. Let's review each napping spot, to start, a couch, now the couch is a great place for a quick nap.
            It is easy to take a quick power nap on the couch but it is even easier to knock out HARD. Couchs provide immediate comfort. They are common in households so they have easy access.
            Next we have the bus. Now the bus is conditional. You have to have a comfy person to nap on. A comfy place to lay your head. With that in mind, if you have a comfortable place to lay your head,
            THEN is it only a preferred nap spot. Now for outside. Napping outside is NOT ideal, since you aren't aware of your surroundings. However if you have someone with you, napping outside is a great
            joy for nappers all around the world. Next we have a bed. This is self explanatory. If you can't nap in a bed, <em><b>YOU</b></em> are doing something wrong. Then we have during class. Now I am 
            <em><b>VERY</b></em> guilty of napping during class. I have taken a 2 hour nap during class before (best nap of my life). However if you are napping on a desk, while it is possible, it is not comfortable
            for the back. Therefore, I am not as much of a fan. Next we have in a car. Now a car is a great place to nap, especially on a road trip. You have everything you need. Air conditioning, comfort, <em><b>EVERYTHING</b></em>. 
            Last but not least, the floor. The floor is comfortable <em><b>ONLY</b></em> when in the mood. The floor is always a possible spot but never a preferred spot. Thank you for listening to my talk about naps.
